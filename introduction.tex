     Earth for the \alert{instant translation of well-known Earth languages}. Gradually, with 
     the removal of language barriers, Earth's disparate cultures came to terms of 
     universal peace. Translations of \alert{previously unknown languages}, such as those of 
     aliens, required more difficulties to be overcome.

     is an "extremely sophisticated computer program" which functions by \alert{analyzing the patterns} of an unknown 
     foreign language, starting from \alert{a speech sample of two or more speakers in conversation}. The more extensive 
     the conversational sample, the more accurate and reliable is the "translation matrix," enabling instantaneous 
     conversion of verbal utterances or written text between the alien language and Federation Standard.
