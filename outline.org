* Introduction (Sam - 15 slides)
  - Proliferation of numerous applications with speech interfaces
  - What kinds of information are available for speech signal -
    speaker, what is spoken, environment
  - What applications can be built to tap into these information
    sources - ASR/LID/Speaker ID technologies
  - This means that when these applications get ported to new domains
    and languages, the speech interfaces also then get used in these
    environments
  - Limit discussion to Speech Recognition
  - What is under the hood for speech recognition technologies?
  - Show how each ASR module relies on transcribed data - GMM based
    technology to current DNN based technology
  - Categorize tutorial topics
    A. New Languages - Building from ASR systems from scratch
    B. New domain - Adaptation of an existing ASR system

* New Languages (Sam - 25 slides)
  - Issues and how they affect performance [amount of transcribed data
    for AM-LM/dictionary]
  - Features front-ends - multilingual feature front-ends
  - Acoustic models - multilingual AM
  - Semi-supervised data/Active Learning for feature front-ends and
    AMs 
  - Do we need to talk about flat-start? (bedk)

* Babel (Brian - 15 slides)
  - Describe the Babel program as an example for development of new
    languages
  - Development of graphemic systems
  - Use of multilingual features/AM (will describe above)
  - Use of Semi-supervised data (will describe above)
  - Web data/LM
  - Concrete examples of ASR development for various languages -
    different techniques used

* KWS (Brian - 25 slides) 
  - Application of ASR systems when WER is still high
  - KWS techniques and metrics
  - How KWS performs for Babel languages   

* New Domains (Bhuvana - 20 slides)
  - Building systems so that they can hold up in novel conditions or
    adapt system
    - Multi-condition training
    - Feature adaptation
    - Model adaptation for GMM - Neural networks
    - LM adaptation

* Recipes (Bhuvana - 15 slides)
  - Babel recipe - new language
  - Aspire example - mismatch AM - multi-condition training
  - Call-center example - mismatch AM - LM

* Summary of current technologies (Bhuvana - 5 slides)

* Research Topics, Challenges, and New Ideas (Florian)

* End-to-End Systems (Florian)

* Virtual Machines and Tools (Florian)

* Conclusions (Florian)
